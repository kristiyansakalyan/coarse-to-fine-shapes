## About the project

We propose a new architecture designed to enhance the geometric detail in 3D shape generation by refining sparse and noisy point clouds.
Our approach combines the strengths of Point-Voxel Convolution (PVConv), Point Transformer, and PU-Net to refine shapes generated by Point-Voxel Diffusion (PVD) in a patch-by-patch manner.
The refinement process is designed to enrich geometric details, resulting in 3D models of higher realism and improved spatial resolution.
Empirical results highlight the architectureâ€™s capability to improve the quality of generated 3D shapes.

This repository is based off the official [Point Voxel Diffusion implementation](https://github.com/alexzhou907/PVD)
